        First of all, the internet is complicated.  There are so many moving parts to it, but our computers
    will only take us to where we want to go.    We usually start with a protocol, typically http or https, if it is 
    secure. Then we need to enter where we want to go.  This can be identified as an IP address which is just a bunch
    of numbers.  Since memorizing numbers can be difficult, especially with a bunch of websites to go to, domain
    names are more common.  Afterwards, we can give a specific request of where we want to go on the domain,
    which is indicated with a /specificrequest.


            An example of this would be https://www.facebook.com/jacob-albiston. We have our https protocol, which fetches
        the resource, or the domain name, facebook.com.  In this example, we have a specific end request we want to go to,
        which is the page jacob-albiston.
